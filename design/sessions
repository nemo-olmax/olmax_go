The session management is pulled right out of astaxie's web design book.
A client connects to the site, and is issued a token. The token is tied into session cookies, and is used to validate login status, tying the token to a username. The username itself is then queried against the database for any additional information

There's not much that happens here as of yet, but eventually the design will generate tokens for each page the user visits, and generate tokens that are seperate and linked to a form on a given page. This allows us to do two things: Stop multiple form submissions, which can happen just from slow internet or user confusion, as well as remove the chance for nefarious people to hijack a client access cookie to do anything that would cause damage to the client
